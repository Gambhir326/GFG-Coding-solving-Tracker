# Count Non-Decreasing Subarrays After K Operations

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Hard-red)

## Problem

You are given an array `nums` of `n` integers and an integer `k`.

For each subarray of `nums`, you can apply  **up to**  `k` operations on it. In each operation, you increment any element of the subarray by 1.

 **Note**  that each subarray is considered independently, meaning changes made to one subarray do not persist to another.

Return the number of subarrays that you can make  **non-decreasing**  ​​​​​after performing at most `k` operations.

An array is said to be  **non-decreasing**  if each element is greater than or equal to its previous element, if it exists.

 

Original
Java
 **Example 1:** 

 **Input:**  nums = [6,3,1,2,4,4], k = 7

 **Output:**  17

 **Explanation:** 

Out of all 21 possible subarrays of `nums`, only the subarrays `[6, 3, 1]`, `[6, 3, 1, 2]`, `[6, 3, 1, 2, 4]` and `[6, 3, 1, 2, 4, 4]` cannot be made non-decreasing after applying up to k = 7 operations. Thus, the number of non-decreasing subarrays is `21 - 4 = 17`.

 **Example 2:** 

 **Input:**  nums = [6,3,1,3,6], k = 4

 **Output:**  12

 **Explanation:** 

The subarray `[3, 1, 3, 6]` along with all subarrays of `nums` with three or fewer elements, except `[6, 3, 1]`, can be made non-decreasing after `k` operations. There are 5 subarrays of a single element, 4 subarrays of two elements, and 2 subarrays of three elements except `[6, 3, 1]`, so there are `1 + 5 + 4 + 2 = 12` subarrays that can be made non-decreasing.

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= nums.length <= 105
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 109
- 1 <= k <= 109

        long ans = 0, water = 0;
        int n = nums.length, r = n - 1;
        for (int l = n - 1; l >= 0; l--) {
            int x = nums[l];
            while (!starts.isEmpty() && nums[starts.peekFirst()] <= x) {  // x floods the plateau that starts at starts.peekFirst()
                int s = starts.pollFirst();
                int end = starts.isEmpty() ? r + 1 : starts.peekFirst();
                water += (long) (x - nums[s]) * (end - s);
            }
            starts.offerFirst(l);
            while (water > k) {  // the right end leaves with its water
                water -= nums[starts.peekLast()] - nums[r];
                if (starts.peekLast() == r)
                    starts.pollLast();
                r--;
            }
            ans += r - l + 1;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
